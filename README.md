# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python practice repo!  
I started learning Python in **August 2025**, and I’m using this space to track my daily progress, examples, and exercises.

---

## 📂 Structure
- **Day1/** → My first Python programs (hello world, basic input/output)  
- **Day2/** → If/else and loops practice  
- **Day3/** → Functions and problem solving  
- *(more will be added as I keep learning)*

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Understand Python basics: variables, loops, conditionals, functions  
- Solve small programming problems daily  
- Build confidence in coding step by step  
- Track my journey publicly on GitHub 🚀

---

## ✅ Notes
- This repo is mainly for **learning and practice**.  
- I will commit code regularly (daily or whenever I practice).  
- Future me: Don’t laugh too much at Day1 code 😅 — it’s all part of the journey!

✨ Thanks for visiting! This repo will grow as I learn more Python.
